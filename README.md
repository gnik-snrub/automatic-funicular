# Automatic-funicular

My attempt at following the guide on creating a Roguelike game in Rust featured here

https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/index.html

Addition features that I'd like to implement include:

x Tweak the world gen to make it more interesting than just rectangles.

x Add in secret passages where <=2 tile wide walls exist.

x Connect dead-end hallways to other rooms.

x Give the player character the ability to steal, and upgrade the powers of monster he slays.

x Possibly add in a random monster generator.

âœ“ Create more color variance in the world tiles.

x Add in some sort of scoring system (Track deepest crawl / fastest crawl / most kills / etc...)
