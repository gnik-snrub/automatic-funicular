My attempt at following the guide on creating a Roguelike game in Rust featured here

https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/index.html

After completing the guide I intend to:
- Tweak the world gen to make it more interesting than just rectangles.
- Add in secret passages where <2 tile wide walls exist.
- Give the player character the ability to steal, and upgrade the powers of monster he slays.
- Possibly add in a random monster generator.
- Create more color variance in the world tiles.
- Add in some sort of scoring system (Track deepest crawl / fastest crawl / most kills / etc...)
